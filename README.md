## What is terraglue?

Hi everyone! Welcome to the official documentation page for **terraglue**, an open source Terraform module developed in order to provide an easy way to deploy a Glue job in any AWS account.

- Are you using Glue for the first time and want to see an end to end ETL example in AWS?
- Do you already have a Spark application and want to deploy it as a Glue job in AWS?
- Do you want to automate the Glue job setup using an IaC tool such as Terraform?
- Have you ever wanted to go the next level on developing Glue jobs?

> **Note**
>  Now the *terraglue* project has an official documentation in readthedocs! Visit the [following link](https://terraglue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and check out usability technical details, practical examples and more!


## Features

- ‚úåÔ∏è Available in two different operation modes: "learning" and "production"
- ü§ñ Possibility to deploy a preconfigured Glue job with a complete end-to-end ETL example when using "learning" mode
- üöÄ Possibility to deploy a custom Glue job according to user needs when using "production" mode
- üëâ Have your Glue job ready and running at the touch of a Terraform module call

## How Does it Work?

When users want to call **terraglue** module from the GitHub source, an operation mode must be chosen. According to this decision, different things happens in the target AWS account.

???+ info "ü§ñ Learning mode"
    The learning mode helps users to understand more about Glue jobs on AWS by providing a complete example with all resources needed to start exploring Glue. It works as following:

    1. A pyspark application is uploaded in a given S3 bucket to be the main script for the Glue job
    2. An auxiliar python file is also uploaded in S3 with useful transformation functions for the job
    3. An IAM role is created with basic permissions to run a Glue job
    4. A KMS key is created to be used in the job security configuration
    5. Finally, a preconfigured Glue job is deployed in order to provide users a example of a SoT table creation using Brazilian E-Commerce data from [datadelivery](https://datadelivery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

???+ info "üöÄ Production mode"
    The production mode enables users to configure and deploy their own Glue jobs in AWS. Its operation depends on how users configure variables on module call. In summary, it works as following:

    1. In this mode, users have the chance to use all the terraglue module variables to customize the deploy
    2. A custom Glue job is deployed in the target AWS account using the variables passed by users on module call

## Combining Solutions

The *terraglue* Terraform module isn't alone. There are other complementary open source solutions that can be put together to enable the full power of learning analytics on AWS. [Check it out](https://github.com/ThiagoPanini) if you think they could be useful for you!
