/* --------------------------------------------------------
FILE: glue.tf

This is probably the main file in the whole module as it is
used to specify and declare a preconfigured Glue job to be
explored by users. This file considers the usage of all
other componentes and resources already declared in other
Terrafom files, such as IAM roles.
