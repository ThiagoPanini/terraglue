# Terraglue: A Poweful Tool for Learning Glue

## Overview

The *terraglue* project was created for helping people to improve their learning journey on AWS Glue service. It accomplishes that by enabling a pocket environment with all necessary componentes to start developing jobs, including S3 buckets, sample data on Data Catalog, IAM roles and policies, a pre configured Athena workgroup and finally an end to end Glue job example that reads, transform and catalog new data.

- Have you ever wanted to learn Glue but you got stuck on a complex environment set up?
- Have you ever wanted to test an idea for an ETL in a pocket and disposable environment?
- Have you ever wanted to go the next level on developing Glue jobs?
