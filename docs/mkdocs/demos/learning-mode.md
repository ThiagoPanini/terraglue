# Learning Mode

What if users don't have a custom Glue job to be deployed but still they want to see and learn more about all the pieces needed to make a Glue job run in AWS? Well, the **learning mode** on terraglue can be used to deploy a preconfigured Glue job with everything is needed to see things running in practice.

Check the [home page](../index.md) to see all things that happen in the target AWS account when we call terraglue on learnind mode.


## Structuring a Terraform Project

If you checked the [production mode demo](production-mode.md) you saw that the Terraform project structured in that context was a little bit more complex. For this demo, as we are talking about using terraglue to deploy a preconfigured Glue job, we will only need a `main.tf` file to put all Terraform code that is required. 

??? question "Why do I need only a main.tf Terraform file when using terraglue on learning mode?"
    Well, there is no need to have different folders in our project to address Glue scripts files, policies or anything. By using terraglue on learning mode, all those elements, files and folders are located inside the module.
    
    You can check all of them on the `.terraform/` folder after running the `terraform init` command.

If you need more information about the structure of a Terraform project you can check the [official Hashicorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure) about it.


## Collecting Terraform Data Sources

Once we structured the Terraform project, let's start by collecting some [Terraform data sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) that will be used along the project. Terraform data sources can improve the development of a Terraform project in a lot of aspects. In the end, this is not a required step, but it can be considered as a good practice according to which resources will be declared and which configurations will be applied.

So, let's take our `main.tf` file and get the three Terraform data sources stated balow:

- A [aws_caller_identity](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/caller_identity) data source to extract the user account id
- A [aws_region](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/region) data source to get the target AWS region

??? example "Collecting Terraform data sources"

    ðŸ’» **Terraform code**:
    ```python
    # Collecting data sources
    data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
    data "aws_region" "current" {}
    ```

Before calling terraglue module, let's call the [datadelivery](https://datadelivery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module in order to deploy buckets, data files, catalog tables and other useful things that is mandatory to use terraglue on learning mode!


## Configuring Datadelivery

> datadelivery is an open source Terraform module that provides an infrastructure toolkit to be deployed in any AWS account in order to help users to explore analytics services like Athena, Glue, EMR, Redshift and others. It does that by uploading and cataloging public datasets that can be used for multiple purposes, either to create jobs or just to query data using AWS services.

When we use terraglue on learning mode, the Glue job deployed on the AWS target account uses buckets and tables delivered by datalivery module. That's why we need to combine both solutions in order to reach the final goal.

??? example "Calling datadelivery module"

    ðŸ’» **Terraform code**:
    ```python
    # Collecting data sources
    data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
    data "aws_region" "current" {}

    # Calling datadelivery module
    module "datadelivery" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/datadelivery?ref=main"
    }
    ```

## Configuring Terraglue

Now we're ready to call terraglue. Unlike the production mode (the default one), the learning mode just need to be passed on `mode` module variable and nothins more is needed.

### Calling The Source Module

This section is all about showing how to call the terraglue module directly from GitHub.

??? example "Calling terraglue module"

    ðŸ’» **Terraform code**:
    ```python
    # Collecting data sources
    data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
    data "aws_region" "current" {}

    # Calling datadelivery module
    module "datadelivery" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/datadelivery?ref=main"
    }

    # Calling terraglue module on learning mode
    module "terraglue" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/terraglue?ref=main"
      
      mode = "learning"
    }
    ```

### Setting Up S3 and Job Outputs

The only thing that is required when calling terraglue on learning mode is the set up three variables:

- `glue_scripts_bucket_name`: to tell terraglue the name of the bucket where the script files are stored
- `job_output_bucket_name` to tell terraglue the name of the output bucket that will store the table generated by the job
- `job_output_database` to tell terraglue the output database that will handle the catalog process of the table generated by the job

??? example "Calling terraglue module"
    [![A video demo showing how to configure terraglue required variables when used on learning mode](https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/terraglue/blob/2.0.x/docs/assets/gifs/terraglue-learning-04-variables.gif?raw=true)](https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/terraglue/blob/2.0.x/docs/assets/gifs/terraglue-learning-04-variables.gif?raw=true)

    ___

    ðŸ’» **Terraform code**:
    ```python
    # Collecting data sources
    data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
    data "aws_region" "current" {}

    # Calling datadelivery module
    module "datadelivery" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/datadelivery?ref=main"
    }

    # Calling terraglue module on learning mode
    module "terraglue" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/ThiagoPanini/terraglue?ref=main"

      mode = "learning"

      # Setting up the scripts bucket name
      glue_scripts_bucket_name = "datadelivery-glue-assets-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}-${data.aws_region.current.name}"

      # Setting up output variables
      job_output_bucket_name = "datadelivery-sot-data-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}-${data.aws_region.current.name}"
      job_output_database = "db_datadelivery_sot"
    }
    ```

And that's literally all! The learning mode was built to make things easiest as possible to users that don't have much experience on deploying Glue jobs in AWS. The idea is to provide an end-to-end example on how things works.

The next step is to run the Terraform commands to deploy the resources in the target AWS account.

## Running Terraform Commands

After all this configuration journey, we now just need to plan and apply the deployment using the respective Terraform commands.

### Terraform plan

With `terraform plan` command, we will be able to see all the resources that will be deployed with the configuration we chose.

??? example "Running the terraform plan command"
    [![A gif showing how to run terraform plan Terraform comand]()]()

### Terraform apply

And now we can finally deploy the infrastructure declared using the `terraform apply` command.

??? example "Running the terraform apply command"

## Deployed Resources

In the end, to finish this demo, let's navigate through all resources deployed in the target AWS account to see a preconfigured Glue job in scene!

âœ… I hope all the demos can help you somehow on using terraglue to learn more about how a Glue job works in practice. Keep reading the docs to become a master user in terraglue!
