# Getting Started with terraglue

As stated before, **terraglue** is an open source Terraform module. So, users who want to use its features should have:

- ☁️ An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) available for use
- 🔑 [Programatic access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) on the account with an `access_key_id` and a `secret_access_key`
- ⛏ [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed (version >=1.4.6)

Work in progress...
